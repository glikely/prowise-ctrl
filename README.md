Prowise Touchscreen control tool
================================

This repository contains a simple tool for controlling a Prowise
touchscreen. It has been tested with a Prowise Classic 65" UHD display.
The code should also work for the Proline and Entryline displays as the
protocol is the same. Quite a few of the commands are different between
the Classic and Pro/Entryline, but both sets of commands are built into
the tool.

I used Prowise's RS232 documentation for Proline/Entryline to develop
this tool.
